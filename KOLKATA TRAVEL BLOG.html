Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta is the capital of India's West Bengal state. 
Founded as an East India Company trading post, it was India's capital under 
the British Raj from 1773–1911. Today it’s known for its grand colonial architecture, 
art galleries and cultural festivals. It’s also home to Mother House, 
headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity, founded by Mother Teresa, 
whose tomb is on site
<br><br>
In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were 
ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab 
granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690, the area 
was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post 
known as Fort William.
<br><br>
Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India 
Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company 
was strong enough to abolish native rule, and assumed full sovereignty of 
the region. Under the company rule and later under the British Raj, 
Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 
1911. At that time, the British assessed its perceived geographical 
disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, and moved 
the capital to New Delhi. Calcutta was the centre for the Indian 
independence movement.
<br><br>
The Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port and its sole major 
riverine port. Kolkata is regarded as the cultural capital of India and the "City of Joy". Kolkata 
is home to West Bengal's film industry Tollywood and cultural institutions, 
such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic Society, 
the Indian Museum, and the National Library of India. Among scientific 
institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India, the 
Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta 
Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the 
Zoological Survey of India, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological 
Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Four Nobel 
laureates and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners are associated with the city.

<DT><B>Exercise Caution with Street Food</B>
<DD>
<OL>
<LI><B>Only eat at popular stalls:</B> The more popular a stall is, the safer its food is likely to be.
<LI><B>Avoid dishes and drinks with water:</B> Water is the leading cause of diarrhea so it’s best to 
avoid dishes made with any water or sauce. Ice cubes are to be avoided and any fruits or vegetables washed 
in undistilled water must be treated with caution, try to look for stalls that prepare their food using distilled water.
<LI><B>Fried or grilled dishes are safer:</B> Heat kills bacteria so fried or grilled dishes are generally safer to eat. 
The same applies to drinks. Hot drinks are typically safer because the water used to make them has been boiled.
When it comes to street food, exercise caution with any dishes made with meat.

<DT><B>Have Patience and Stay Cool</B>
<DD>India is a life-changing experience, It will shock or awe tourists, or both. There doesn’t seem to be a middle 
ground people either love it or hate it but regardless of how one feels, it’s always a good idea to remain calm and keep a cool head.
If one is from a developed country, then they can’t visit India expecting things to work like they do in your country.
But its definitely worth giving it a try.
